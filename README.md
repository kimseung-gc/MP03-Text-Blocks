## Description
```
I created a program that can horizontally/vertically flip textblocks, and classes that can
truncate, center, and right justify the text blocks. It also includes diagonally flipping
class which is equivalent as flipping horizontally once and vertically once which I 
implemented for third part of the mini-project.
